# Overview

This is a location-based travel guide application called "ÎÇ¥ÏÜêÍ∞ÄÏù¥Îìú" (My Hand Guide) that allows users to create, manage, and share travel guides with photos and location information. The app features AI-powered content generation using Google's Gemini AI to automatically create guide descriptions, tips, and cultural information based on uploaded images and GPS coordinates. Users can capture photos with location data, organize guides, create shareable links, and manage their travel content through a mobile-optimized interface.

## üìù Recent Changes

### üîó Share Feature Implementation (2025-10-02) - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Previous share system was broken by predecessor developer
**Solution:** Complete reimplementation of share functionality from scratch
**Changes:**
1. **Database Schema** (`shared/schema.ts`)
   - Created `sharedHtmlPages` table with 8-character short IDs
   - Fields: id (short), userId, name, htmlContent, guideIds[], thumbnail, sender, location
   - Supports isActive flag for link expiration control

2. **Backend Storage** (`server/storage.ts`)
   - Implemented `createSharedHtmlPage()` with ID collision retry logic (5 attempts)
   - Added `getSharedHtmlPage()`, `incrementDownloadCount()`, `getFeaturedHtmlPages()`
   - Short ID generation using crypto.randomBytes(6).toString('base64url')

3. **API Routes** (`server/routes.ts`)
   - POST `/api/share/create` - Creates share page and returns short URL
   - GET `/s/:id` - Serves HTML content directly (primary share route)
   - GET `/api/share/:id` - JSON endpoint for programmatic access
   - Comprehensive error pages (404, 410, 500) with styled HTML

4. **Frontend Implementation** (`public/index.js`, `public/index.html`)
   - Simplified share modal (removed social icons: Kakao, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp)
   - Single "ÎßÅÌÅ¨ Î≥µÏÇ¨ÌïòÍ∏∞" (Copy Link) button for universal sharing
   - Modal reset logic to fix "Îã§ÏãúÌïòÎãà ÏïàÎê®" (can't use twice) bug
   - Automatic HTML generation from selected guides
   - Clipboard integration for easy sharing

**Technical Details:**
- URL format: `yourdomain.com/s/abc12345` (8 characters)
- HTML pages are self-contained (images embedded as data URLs)
- Download count tracking on every access
- Link expiration via isActive flag
- Temp user ID system (to be replaced with real auth)

**Impact:** 
- ‚úÖ Share links work in browser, KakaoTalk, and all messaging apps
- ‚úÖ Short URLs easy to type manually (8 characters vs previous 36)
- ‚úÖ Modal can be reused multiple times without refresh
- ‚úÖ Complete system with detailed code comments for future maintenance

### Critical Fix (2025-10-01) - Subscription Data Restoration
**Issue:** Users lost all data (guides, share links) when canceling and resubscribing
**Solution:** Implemented soft-delete subscription system with data preservation
**Changes:**
- Added `subscriptionStatus`, `subscriptionCanceledAt`, `accountStatus` fields to user schema
- Created subscription management endpoints: `/api/subscription/cancel` and `/api/subscription/reactivate`
- Account suspension instead of deletion - all user data preserved during subscription gaps
**Impact:** Users can now cancel and resubscribe without losing any data

### URL Optimization (2025-09-24)
**Issue:** Users reported browser URL input errors due to excessively long share URLs (36 characters)
**Solution:** Implemented short URL system reducing URL length by 67% (36 ‚Üí 12 characters)
**Impact:** Users can now easily type share URLs directly into browser address bar
