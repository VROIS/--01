# Overview

This is a location-based travel guide application called "ÎÇ¥ÏÜêÍ∞ÄÏù¥Îìú" (My Hand Guide) that allows users to create, manage, and share travel guides with photos and location information. The app features AI-powered content generation using Google's Gemini AI to automatically create guide descriptions, tips, and cultural information based on uploaded images and GPS coordinates. Users can capture photos with location data, organize guides, create shareable links, and manage their travel content through a mobile-optimized interface.

## üìù Recent Critical Fix (2025-09-24)
**Issue:** Users reported browser URL input errors due to excessively long share URLs (36 characters)
**Solution:** Implemented short URL system reducing URL length by 67% (36 ‚Üí 12 characters)
**Impact:** Users can now easily type share URLs directly into browser address bar

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
